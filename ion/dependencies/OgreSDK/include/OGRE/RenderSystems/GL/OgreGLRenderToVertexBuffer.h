        An object which renders geometry to a vertex.
    @remarks
        This is especially useful together with geometry shaders, as you can
        render procedural geometry which will get saved to a vertex buffer for
        reuse later, without regenerating it again. You can also create shaders
        that run on previous results of those shaders, creating stateful 
        shaders.
