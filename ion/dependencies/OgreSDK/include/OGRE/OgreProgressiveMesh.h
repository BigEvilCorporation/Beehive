        which have multiple frames.
    @par
        The primary use for this is generating LOD versions of Mesh objects, but it can be
        used by any geometry provider. The only limitation at the moment is that the 
        provider uses a common vertex buffer for all LODs and one index buffer per LOD.
        Therefore at the moment this class can only handle indexed geometry.
    @par
        NB the interface of this class will certainly change when compiled vertex buffers are
        supported.

			 There are 2 ways that you can create level-of-detail (LOD) versions of a mesh;
			 the first is to call this method, which does fairly extensive calculations to
			 work out how to simplify the mesh whilst having the minimum affect on the model.
			 The alternative is to actually create simpler versions of the mesh yourself in 
			 a modelling tool, and having exported them, tell the 'master' mesh to use these
			 alternative meshes for lower detail versions; this is done by calling the 
			 createManualLodLevel method.
		 @par
			 As well as creating the lower detail versions of the mesh, this method will
			 also associate them with depth values. As soon as an object is at least as far
			 away from the camera as the depth value associated with it's LOD, it will drop 
			 to that level of detail. 
		 @par
			 I recommend calling this method before mesh export, not at runtime.
			 @param lodValues A list of lod values indicating the values at which new lods should be
			 generated. These are 'user values', before being potentially 
			 transformed by the strategy, so for the distance strategy this is an
			 unsquared distance for example.

		 @param reductionValue Meaning depends on reductionMethod, typically either the proportion
