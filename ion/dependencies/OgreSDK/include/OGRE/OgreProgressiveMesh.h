        This class is dedicated to reducing the number of triangles in a given mesh
        taking into account seams in both geometry and texture co-ordinates and meshes 
        which have multiple frames.
    @par
        The primary use for this is generating LOD versions of Mesh objects, but it can be
        used by any geometry provider. The only limitation at the moment is that the 
        provider uses a common vertex buffer for all LODs and one index buffer per LOD.
        Therefore at the moment this class can only handle indexed geometry.
    @par
        NB the interface of this class will certainly change when compiled vertex buffers are
        supported.
