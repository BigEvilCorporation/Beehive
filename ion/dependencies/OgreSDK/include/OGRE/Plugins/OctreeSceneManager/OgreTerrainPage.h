        does not actually process or initialise them itself - this is 
        intentional so the TerrainPageSource which is providing the tiles
        is able to load and prepare each renderable incrementally if required,

        to place the TerrainRenderable pointers, which it does on 
        construction. Note that this structure is public to allow completely
        free access to users of this class.
