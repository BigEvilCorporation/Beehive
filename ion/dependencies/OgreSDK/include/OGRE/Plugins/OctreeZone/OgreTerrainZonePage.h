        Note that this class, whilst holding onto TerrainZoneRenderable instances, 
        does not actually process or initialise them itself - this is 
        intentional so the TerrainZonePageSource which is providing the tiles
        is able to load and prepare each renderable incrementally if required, 
        thus avoiding any 'single hit' load methods for the page.
    @par
        All this class does do is pre-create a 2D vector of 'slots' in which 
        to place the TerrainZoneRenderable pointers, which it does on 
        construction. Note that this structure is public to allow completely
        free access to users of this class.
