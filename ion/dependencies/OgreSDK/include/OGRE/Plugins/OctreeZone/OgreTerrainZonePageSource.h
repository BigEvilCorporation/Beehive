    /** Abstract class which describes the interface which a source of terrain 
        pages must implement.
    @remarks
        The TerrainZone can accept external classes as providers of
        terrain data, to allow terrain height data to come from anywhere the
        user application may choose, and additionally to support on-demand
        loading an unloading of terrain data. Providers must suclass this class, 
        and implement the abstract methods (details are described within each method)
    @par
        The overall sequence of events is this:
        <ol>
        <li>TerrainZone is created as usual, and options such as tile
        size etc are set.</li>
        <li>CustomTerrainZonePageSource is registered with TerrainZone by 
        calling registerPageSource(), registering a particular named type of source 
        data with this tile source. <li>
        <li>TerrainZone::setZoneGeometry is called. Depending on the
        configuration, this will call one of the page source classes 
        initialise methods, when the scene manager will communicate it's 
        preferred options. It does not have to load anything immediately on this 
        call (especially if the terrain options include paging). It will 
        also set this tile source as the primary.<li>
        <li>As and when TerrainZone requires more tiles (and this will
        either be done all up-front, or progressively depending on paging settings)
        it will call the primary tile source's requestPage() method, with the 
        page it requires. </li>
        <li>It is then the responsibility of the tile source to prepare
        TerrainRenderable instances for the page(s) requested, and to attach them 
        to the TerrainZone. Note that preparing the tiles does not
        involve modifying any shared data so may be done in an alternate thread,
        if required. Attaching them must be done synchronously though.
        <li>When paging, the TerrainZone will request tiles in advance,
        within it's 'buffer zone' so some delay in loading is acceptable. It
        will also indicate when tiles are no longer required (and will detach
        them); it is up to the tile source whether that memory is actually freed
        or held for a while longer.
        </ol>
    @note The comments on paging above are in principle, the implementation of
    paging in this manager is not present yet but the system is designed to 
    extend to it. For now, all tiles are requested up-front.

            the page requested and attach the entire page when ready using 
            TerrainZone::attachTerrainZonePage.
        @par
            Now, the tile source does not necessarily need to do all that before the
            return of this method. If it likes, and particularly if asynchronous 
            loading is enabled, it can merely queue this request, and process it
            either in another thread, or over a series of frames. The key thing
            is that attaching the new page has to be done synchronously with 
            the main rendering loop in order to avoid concurrency issues; 
            other than that, you are free to load and prepare new tiles in 
            a concurrent fashion if you like.
        @par

            with the possibility of requesting more if paging is enabled.

            When paging is enabled, tiles go out of scope and the TerrainZone
            detaches them automatically, notifying the TerrainZonePageSource that 
            this has happened. The tile source can choose to either keep these
            tiles in memory (incase they are requested again) or can delete them

            freeing of them can be done in another thread or across many frames
            if required, since the shared data in TerrainZone has already
            been updated synchronously when the page was detached.
